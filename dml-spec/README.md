# Deception Markup Language (DML)

**DML** is a small, versioned, HMAC-signable schema for declaring deception
assets — honeypots, canaries, and tripwires — as portable documents. Instead
of scattering trap logic across your codebase, you describe traps once, in one
file, and ship that file between systems with confidence that it has not been
tampered with in transit or at rest.

A **DML document** is a versioned set of **traps**. Each trap pairs a
**trigger** (what an attacker has to do to set it off) with a **response**
(how the trap reacts), plus metadata (severity, MITRE ATT&CK tactic, tags) and
alerting intent.

## Why versioned + signed deception config matters

Deception only works if attackers can't distinguish traps from real assets —
and operators can't afford to deploy traps they can't trust. Two properties
make a deception config trustworthy:

- **Versioned.** A document declares the DML spec version it targets, so
  consumers can reject documents they don't understand instead of
  misinterpreting them. Trap IDs are namespaced and must be unique, so two
  teams can merge configs without silent collisions.
- **Signed.** Trap definitions are exactly the kind of high-value config an
  attacker who gains a foothold would love to quietly edit — disabling the
  tripwire that would catch them, or pointing a "block" response at log-only.
  DML signs every trap **and** the document as a whole with HMAC-SHA256, so
  any edit — to a field, a trap, or the set of traps — is detectable as long
  as the signing key stays secret.

## Trigger types

The nine trigger types — the kind of attacker activity that fires a trap:

| Trigger type     | Fires when…                                              | Key fields                       |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `http_request`   | a request hits a planted path/method                     | `path` (required), `method`      |
| `dns_resolution` | a planted hostname is resolved                           | `hostname` (required)            |
| `api_key_use`    | a planted API key (by prefix) is used                    | `api_key_prefix`                 |
| `file_access`    | a canary file is opened                                  | `path`                           |
| `login_attempt`  | a login is attempted against a decoy credential          | `match_regex`                    |
| `data_access`    | a canary database record is read                         | `record_id`                      |
| `timing_probe`   | response-timing probing is detected                      | `timing_target_ms` (required)    |
| `canary_email`   | mail arrives at a canary address                         | `email` (required)               |
| `jwt_use`        | a planted/forged JWT is presented                        | `match_regex`                    |

## Response types

The eight response types — how a trap reacts once triggered:

| Response type      | Effect                                                       | Key fields                       |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `fake_data`        | serve fabricated data to the attacker                       | `fake_data_template`, `http_status` |
| `redirect_sandbox` | divert the session into a sandbox/decoy environment         | `redirect_url`, `sandbox_reason` |
| `delay_response`   | tarpit — stall the response                                 | `delay_ms` (required)            |
| `mirror_engage`    | engage the attacker (e.g. LLM-driven mirroring)             | `llm_prompt_override`, `llm_model` |
| `block_ip`         | block the source                                            | —                                |
| `log_only`         | record the event, no visible reaction                       | —                                |
| `alert_only`       | fire an alert, no visible reaction                          | —                                |
| `honeypot_auth`    | accept the credential into a honeypot auth flow             | `http_status`                    |

Severity levels: `critical`, `high`, `medium`, `low`, `info`.
MITRE tactics: the standard ATT&CK enterprise tactic set (e.g.
`credential_access`, `discovery`, `exfiltration`).

## Install

```bash
pip install .               # from a checkout
# runtime dependency: PyYAML>=6
```

## Quickstart

```python
from dml import DMLValidator, DMLSigner, load, dumps

doc = load("examples/example_traps.yaml")

# 1. Validate against the spec.
errors = DMLValidator().validate_document(doc)
assert not errors, errors

# 2. Sign (the key is supplied by you, never hardcoded in the library).
signer = DMLSigner.from_env("DML_KEY")     # or DMLSigner("my-secret")
signed = signer.sign_document(doc)

# 3. Verify — detects any tampering with traps or the document.
ok, errors = signer.verify_document(signed)
assert ok

print(dumps(signed, fmt="yaml"))
```

Build a document from your own records (no ORM/framework coupling):

```python
from dml import DMLTrap, DMLTrigger, build_document

traps = [
    DMLTrap(id="secret-path", name="Hidden endpoint",
            trigger=DMLTrigger(type="http_request", path="/internal/.env")),
]
doc = build_document(traps, platform="my-app", namespace="prod")
```

Run the full round-trip example:

```bash
DML_KEY=test-key-123 python examples/quickstart.py
```

## CLI

The signing key is read from an environment variable (default `DML_KEY`) — it
is **never** passed as a command-line literal, so it can't leak into shell
history or process listings.

```bash
python -m dml validate examples/example_traps.yaml
python -m dml sign     examples/example_traps.yaml --key-env DML_KEY -o signed.yaml
python -m dml verify   signed.yaml --key-env DML_KEY
python -m dml schema
```

Example output:

```text
$ python -m dml validate examples/example_traps.yaml
OK: valid DML document (5 traps)

$ DML_KEY=test-key-123 python -m dml sign examples/example_traps.yaml --key-env DML_KEY -o signed.yaml
OK: signed document written to signed.yaml

$ DML_KEY=test-key-123 python -m dml verify signed.yaml --key-env DML_KEY
OK: document signature valid

$ DML_KEY=wrong python -m dml verify signed.yaml --key-env DML_KEY
FAILED: verification failed:
   - Document signature mismatch — document may be tampered
```

## The signing model

DML signs at **two levels** with **HMAC-SHA256**:

- **Per-trap.** Each trap carries a `signature` field — an HMAC over the
  trap's contents with the `signature` field itself excluded. This lets a
  consumer attribute tampering to a specific trap.
- **Whole-document.** The document carries a `document_signature` — an HMAC
  over the document identity fields (`dml_version`, `platform`, `namespace`)
  plus every trap with its per-trap signature stripped. This binds the set of
  traps together: adding, removing, or editing any trap (even with a forged
  per-trap signature) invalidates the document signature.

**Canonicalization.** Before signing, the relevant object is serialized
deterministically as compact JSON with sorted keys:

```python
canonical = json.dumps(obj, sort_keys=True, separators=(",", ":"))
signature = hmac.new(key, canonical.encode(), hashlib.sha256).hexdigest()[:32]
```

Verification recomputes the canonical form and compares signatures in
constant time.

**Key handling.** The HMAC key is supplied by the **caller** — via the
`DMLSigner(key)` constructor or `DMLSigner.from_env("DML_KEY")`. The library
contains no default, fallback, or hardcoded key; a missing key raises rather
than signing with a guessable value. Keep the key secret: anyone who has it
can forge valid signatures.
