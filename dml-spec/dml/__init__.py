"""Deception Markup Language (DML).

A versioned, signable schema for declaring deception traps — honeypots,
canaries, and tripwires — as portable documents. A DML document is a set of
traps; each trap pairs a *trigger* (what an attacker does) with a *response*
(how the trap reacts), plus metadata and alerting intent. Documents are
signed with HMAC-SHA256 at both the per-trap and whole-document level so
tampering is detectable.

Public API:

    Spec types / enums:
        DML_VERSION, TRIGGER_TYPES, RESPONSE_TYPES, SEVERITY_LEVELS,
        MITRE_TACTICS, DMLDocument, DMLTrap, DMLTrigger, DMLResponse,
        DMLAlert

    Validation:
        DMLValidator, DMLValidationError

    Signing:
        DMLSigner

    I/O & building:
        load, loads, dump, dumps, to_dict, build_document
